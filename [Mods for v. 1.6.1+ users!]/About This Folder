Temporary 1.6.1 - 1.7.0 models

If you have updated to Beat Saber version 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, or 1.7.0 you have probably noticed that my models won't work. I didn't want to update them because
they would work after BMBF updates. But then dany_ev3 came on Discord and asked me if he could update them for me. So thanks to him you can
get them right here!
