# BMBF Asset mods
Welcome to BMBF asset mods! Here's all my asset mods (mods that changes sabers, menu music, menu titles and a lot more) I've made for Beat Saber for the Oculus Quest. To get it into Beat Saber, simply download a .zip file and upload it to BMBF on your PC. You can also find this repository inside your headset through BMBF and press "Download". Everything is updated to Beat Saber v1.7.0.

### Have you modeled a saber yourself that you want to be in Beat Saber?
I can send your 3D modeled saber into Beat Saber for $3. There's just some requirements:

1. Your 3D model should not be too high poly.

2. Separate your model in 3 different .obj's: One for the "Blade", one for the "Handle" and one for the "GlowingEdges".
