# BMBF Asset mods [This repository is outdated and I don't use it anymore]
Welcome to BMBF asset mods! Here's all my asset mods (mods that changes sabers, menu music, menu titles and a lot more) I've made for Beat Saber for the Oculus Quest. To get it into Beat Saber, simply download a .zip file and upload it to BMBF on your PC. You can also find this repository inside your headset through BMBF. Everything is updated to Beat Saber v1.7.0.
